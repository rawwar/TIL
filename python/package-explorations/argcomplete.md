# argcomplete



**Picked up directly from** [**argcomplete pypi page**](https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/)\
Argcomplete provides easy, extensible command line tab completion of arguments for your Python application.

<mark style="color:red;">It makes two assumptions:</mark>

* You’re using bash or zsh as your shell
* You’re using [argparse](http://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to manage your command line arguments/options

Argcomplete is particularly useful if your program has lots of options or subparsers, and if your program can dynamically suggest completions for your argument/option values (for example, if the user is browsing resources over the network).
